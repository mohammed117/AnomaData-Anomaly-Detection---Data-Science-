## Introduction
AnomaData is built to detect anomalies within a dataset, with a primary focus on fraud detection. The system employs machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost, to classify normal and anomalous data points.



## Setup

### AWS Account Setup

To use this project, you'll need an AWS account. Follow these steps to set up your AWS account:

1. Go to the AWS website and click on "Create an AWS Account".
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the account creation process.
3. Once your account is set up, log in to the AWS Management Console.

### AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance Setup

To deploy the model, you'll need an AWS SageMaker notebook instance. Follow these steps to set up your SageMaker notebook instance:

1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Amazon SageMaker.
2. Click on "Notebook instances" in the left navigation pane.
3. Click on "Create notebook instance" and follow the on-screen instructions to configure your instance.
4. Once your notebook instance is created, open Jupyter Notebook and upload your project files.


## Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, transforming, and scaling numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and potential patterns. 

## Model Training
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the XGBoost classifier is trained on the resampled training data to classify anomalies.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the XGBoost model's performance. The best hyperparameters are selected based on precision.

## Model Deployment
The trained XGBoost model is deployed using Amazon SageMaker. Data is uploaded to an S3 bucket, and the model is deployed on a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference.

## Evaluation
The deployed model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to assess the model's performance.

## Conclusion
AnomaData provides an effective solution for anomaly detection, particularly in fraud detection scenarios. By leveraging machine learning techniques and advanced model tuning, the system achieves high precision in identifying anomalies within datasets.
